# These resources must be healthy before annontated subsequent resources are reconciled
# Limitations:
#   1. Resources may not be in their own or later sync waves
#     Ex: Rancher can not be in wave 1 through wave 5
#   2. Currently only the targeted resource is waited for, not all resources in the sync wave
